I've learned a lot about myself in the past six months. I left a toxic work environment after working there on and off for almost six years. Part of the reason I stayed there for so long (and even came back after another job didn't work out) was because after the first couple of years I no longer felt like an imposter.

As a developer who:
- doesn't have a CS degree
- hasn't worked at Google or Amazon
- isn't on the core team of any open-source project
- doesn't have a cool side project that generates passive income
- has, like, 5 followers on Twitter

it's difficult to find validation.
